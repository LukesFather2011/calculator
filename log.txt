I finished adding functionality to the calculator. I was able to
 get the display to update properly, as well. However, how I have to solve
 how to stop forced decimal places.

 I also am trying to solve what happens if the "=" is pressed to early. I've 
 implemented a "step" variable that I am using to keep track of where the calculations
 are at. However, I am having some difficulty implementing this. Basically, nothing should
 happen if the "=" is pressed before the second number has been entered.
