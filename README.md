# Calculator
Odin Project's calculator project. 

This was a hell of a project for me. Kind of the Great Barrier. It took me 3 attempts over the course of a year. I would get pretty far along, then take a break due to frustration. 

However, this break turned into quitting because I built it up in my mind so much. One day, I just decided to sit down, wipe the repository, and start over. And that is just the motivation I needed!

I completed most of the tasks except for the keyboard functionality. I also have some personal gripes, like the display overflowing if too many digits are on screen. But, I feel like I achieved everything I needed to, and learned a lot along the way. Maybe one day I'll come back to it and clean the code up, and add that extra functionality. But for now, I am satisfied and ready to move on. 

Completing this has renewed my vigor for the course, and I am excited to keep learning!
